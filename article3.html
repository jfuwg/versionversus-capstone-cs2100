                <h2>Don't Forget About CRT's</h2>

                <p>Remember those blocky tvs/monitors that would weight a ton? You do? Great. You don't? Uh oh,
                    you probably think they're obsolete and ancient huh? Well..they certaintly aren't being produced
                    any longer so you're not completely wrong, as LCDs are the standard. But before LCDs were even a
                    thing, all people could use was CRTs. Not to get into specifics but basically it uses a different
                    technology to display an image on screen, and so the displays can look pretty different. <br><br>
                    But what's the big deal you say? You've seen the scanlines on these things, thank god we have clear
                    LCD screens now!...except these scanlines actually were important for at least one thing,
                    videogames.
                    We celebrate the retro "pixel" art style today and we see screenshots and think "huh, it looks
                    blocky"
                    but that wasn't exactly so back then. LCDs are so 'clear' to the point we see all those individual
                    pixels,
                    but CRTs actually smoothed out those pixels (somewhat, to varying degrees). The result, especially
                    from
                    afar, is a smoother looking art style. Even in early 3D games, CRTs help vastly in hiding
                    imperfections
                    and making the game look better.

                <p> Just based on this, we can see how the raw pixels look against the same image on a CRT screen.
                    Notice
                    how the right looks "blended" in a sense, and creates depth and a clear facial structure. This is
                    what
                    people were actually seeing back then. Many play on emulators nowadays, on LCD screens, and they
                    experience
                    those raw pixels. In a sense, they don't get the original visual experience. Developers worked with
                    the CRT
                    tech to complete their vision, so all those pixel art images online aren't how they would really
                    appear back then.
                    I remember getting my first CRT, and I couldn't believe how a simple pixelized water fountain
                    suddenly looked
                    like actual water flowing on my screen, glistening and all. Even without an actual CRT, there are
                    filters to
                    get the intended look in emulators (though its not as good). 3D PS1 and N64 games always looked so
                    undercooked
                    and raw lookswise when I played them at first, but on a CRT their imperfections are softened, and I
                    see how
                    appealing they really look.

                <p>
                    I see people confused on why things looked "better" back then even though we have HD now, and
                    the
                    answer usually lies in how CRT's despite their flaws, had a great display. These things aren't
                    being
                    produced, but they're still out there. I highly reccomend that whomever reads this gets one for
                    their
                    setup. Search on Facebook Marketplace, thrift stores, flea markets, and E-Recycling centers if
                    you can.
                    Ebay is usually a no go, too pricey when theres always free/cheap ones laying around. My point
                    in closing, DON'T dismiss this technology, it can be a game changer and give you the authentic
                    presentation of a game's visuals. At the very least, remember that CRTs were actually pretty dang
                    cool.
