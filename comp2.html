                <h2>Final Fantasy 7: Original VS Remake</h2>

                <p>First off, this article will only cover the first Final Fantasy 7 Remake, as it is split in 3 games,
                    and only 2 are out. This first part extends the first 4-5 hours of the OG game into a full 40 hour
                    game.
                    Somehow the 2nd part is even longer...but they each deserve their own article. Setting some context,
                    the OG
                    game came out in 1997 on PS1 while the first remake came out in 2020 for PS4. Being one of the most
                    influential games ever,
                    it was only inetivitable that people wanted this game in new packaging, and so they began their work
                    and announced
                    it in 2015. 5 years to release was a long time, but they wanted to put their upmost effort into
                    this.
                    <br><br> To many people's surprise, this remake reinvisions the story and gameplay radically. Many
                    wanted
                    a 1:1 remake with better graphics but this new experience is more interesting in my opinion. 1:1
                    remakes are boring to me.
                </p>

                    <img src="ff7og.jpg" class="slider-before" alt="Before image of OG FF7">
                    <img src="ff7re.jpg" class="slider-after" alt="After image of FF7 Remake">

                </div>
                <p>Story wise, it follows the original quite closely, but in a more expanded sense of course. It really
                    lets you
                    take in the city state of Midgar more than OG FF7 could. After all, it is the only setting of the
                    game in part 1,
                    while part 2 focuses on the open world. Sooner than later, the story suddenly introduces an element
                    that, in non
                    spoiler terms, makes it later clear that this game is intended to be played after the original. It's
                    fine to play this first
                    but from what I have played from Remake and Rebirth(part 2), you will appreciate this game
                    infinitely more if you
                    have played the OG game alongside the prequel Crisis Core. The OG is a classic for a reason, don't
                    think the
                    remake replaces it for one bit. After all, the remake trilogy isn't even finished.<br><br> But you
                    came here
                    to check out the differences right? Well most obviously the remake looks gorgeous. I don't always
                    like the colors
                    and lighting but it really does make you feel like you're in the slums, and every character looks
                    just like how a kid
                    back then would imagine them. The battles are always so fun to look at, and it feels epic to play.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                    <img src="ff7combat.jpg" class="slider-before" alt="Before image of OG FF7 gameplay">
                    <img src="ff7recombat.jpg" class="slider-after" alt="After image of FF7 Remake gameplay">
                    <div class="slider-handle"></div>
                </div>
                <p>But how do the battles feel in gameplay? Well the original is turn based, as many RPGs were in that
                    day.
                    The combat system is truly amazing in both games thanks to the materia system, which allows you to
                    equip "Materia"
                    with different spells and effects. I would say the turn based combat is pretty standard otherwise
                    but its what makes
                    those original Final Fantasy games so classic. The remake uses a real time action system where you
                    can actually move around
                    and perform whatever move you want whenever. Although turn based and real time are exact opposites,
                    somehow I would say
                    the original combat translates so well to the remake, because it really retains most everything
                    else. What I will say is that
                    I hated how much I was just spamming the normal attack button in the latter game, as turn based
                    gives your actions much more weight.
                    Both are equally fun, but I was less tired with the former. <br><br> Musically, the OG soundtrack is
                    a classic,
                    and the remake has amazing new renditions of those old tracks, you can tell how much effort and love
                    was put in.
                    Thanks to the extended length, the characters really shine in the remake, so well in fact I think
                    it's worth playing
                    just to see your favorite characters expanded on. The amount of love put into this remake is
                    great...but there are some
                    negatives. <br><br>
                    The gameplay outside of the combat is not very good and has some of the worst trends in modern
                    gaming like wretched fetch side quests
                    and filler battles that feel like time wasters. The changes to the story can be a bit undercooked
                    and can be confusing but
                    I guess thats what the sequels are for. Granted the original has its own problems so all considered
                    this isn't that bad.
                    For a game that stretches a couple hours of the orignal into a whole game, it didn't fail, and I
                    appreciate that they're taking
                    their time on this, but the padding just kills it sometimes. <br><br> Overall, you can't really go
                    wrong with either but
                    I really would reccomend (for basically every game on this site) to play the original and then the
                    remake, but for this entry,
                    its specifically because the game assumes you already have experience with the game. I love both
                    these games and I would say
                    you should play FF7 any way you can (any version with toggle random encounters is great). But for
                    the remake know playing the trilogy
                    might take a couple hundreds hours of your life...Enjoy!
