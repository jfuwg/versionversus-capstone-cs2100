                <h2>What's this website?</h2>

                <p>This website is for those who want to compare different versions of the same game.
                    By versions I mean the original release of the game, and it's remake/and or remaster.
                    This sites provides more than just comparisons, like articles on what we mean by remake and
                    remaster.
                    Hopefully this can persuade your choice of version to play too.
                </p>
                <h2>Why make this website?</h2>
                <p>In brief, I have had many times where I have wanted to compare a game like Final Fantasy 7 and it's
                    remake but
                    that type of content is usually in the form of a long video. Sometimes I just don't have the
                    patience for that.
                    My goal then, was to make a website where you could get the most vital bits of comparison without
                    spoilers and
                    compile short form comparison guides for various games. It also has it's own certain advantages,
                    such as acting
                    as a hub for further self research by providing video links and other articles. I hope the viewer
                    may enjoy this
                    website and find it useful...and why not participate in the survey below?
