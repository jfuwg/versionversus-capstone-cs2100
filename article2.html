                <h2>Why Play The Original Over A Remake/Remaster?</h2>

                <p>"Dude, why would I play a 20 year old 10 polygon game when there's a modern remake?" is what you may
                    think
                    when you hear someone reccomend the original game, and you're not wrong in wanting to just play the
                    remake
                    it it's easily accessible and fits your modern tastes. Go ahead..but hear me out before you do.
                    <br><br>Games
                    are an artform, barely anyone disputes that. Yet, gamers do not like to treat it as such, and so
                    remakes in their
                    head immediately replace the original to them, because why play the version with worse graphics?
                    What they don't
                    realize is that these versions constitute two distinct art works, with their own visions! Yes a
                    remake might have
                    some or all of the original team back, but these same people can create wildly different visions of
                    their own work.
                    <br><br>Just take the above picture, from Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Reload respectively, and you
                    would instantly
                    notice how different the lighting looks, and how it changes the mood. One might say "Well if they
                    could've done the
                    lighting in the orignal game if they could" and maybe so, but they worked with what they have, and
                    made their vision
                    come true, it isn't unfinished or inferior because they couldn't do what later generations could.
                    There has been a trend
                    in recent times to make the "best" graphics possible. Hyperrealism seems to be the goal, and for
                    developers of remakes,
                    this can lead to a completely different style than the original. A PS1 game getting a PS5 Remake is
                    obviously going to get
                    a major graphical fidelity update but this focus on graphics can sublate the original's style(in
                    mostly negative ways).
                    As a work of art, the remake can have it's own vision sure, but this sublation is exactly WHY THE
                    ORIGINAL HAS WORTH.

                <p>Let us take these pictures from Resident Evil 3 and it's remake. At first glance, you can already
                    tell that these are wildly
                    different in visual style. Even apart from fidelity, the top takes a fixed 3rd person camera angle,
                    which makes for a more
                    cinematic look, which was more common back then (less to load, looks good, tricky to play with). The
                    bottom takes a behind the
                    shoulder view (that dynamically moves with you), this is more common nowadays as games can render
                    more at once. Two distinct styles,
                    ones that actually affect the gameplay as well. Shooting your enemies with a fixed camera angle is a
                    hassle to many, and missin your shots
                    can feel bad, but it gives it a different kind of playstyle. The bottom game just needs you to put
                    your target in the center of your screen,
                    which is much easier but may give less anxiety. Boom, even more reason to experience both
                    right?<br><br> Even more specific, the remake simply
                    doesn't have all the originals content! From personal experience it is far shorter, and left much to
                    be desired. That's not the case for most
                    remakes, but cut content can be a big deal...especially when new content is added that isn't as
                    good! In this case I am talking about
                    a remake like Silent Hill 2(2024), which cuts a DLC from the original, and pads out the game.
                    Sorting through these details is more for the
                    comparison guides but it's why I made this site...because not everyone knows these things, or even
                    that they matter at all.
                    I love some remakes, I hate some remakes, but I mostly think one thing, it doesn't replace the
                    original. No matter how Konami markets
                    Resident Evil 3's remake without "remake" in the title in an attempt to replace the original, it
                    won't. This is more to say, there is
                    worth in both versions (even if one can sometimes have less) and that it is often time worth playing
                    both! But I am cautious of people who
                    have played a remake of a classic but dismiss the original because they "already played the remake".
                    Please, if you love the remake, chances are
                    you will love the original (after all why remake it if it wasn't somewhat popular). I could go much
                    more into detail but this is quite enough to
                    make my point, so think carefully next time you want to experience a game.
