                <h2>What Is The Difference Between A Remaster And A Remake?</h2>

                <p>Many visitors to this site might already know the differences
                    but it would be unfair to leave anyone in the dark on this matter.
                    This will also hopefully show the purpose of this website so let us
                    all be on the same page. I will lay out a small table of differences
                    that will aid us along this explanation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <table>
                <tr>

                    <td>Improves visual fidelity, audio, and performance while keeping core gameplay.</td>
                    <td>Rebuilds entire game from ground up, often using new engine, assets, and gameplay.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Updated to accommodate newer consoles to make it work.</td>
                    <td>Overhauled to be native to new consoles, no revision to original code.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Usually marketed as an enhanced, polished version.</td>
                    <td>Usually marketed as a modern, new take on an original.</td>
                </tr>

                <p>Don't click off yet! It's still worth exploring further how these relate to the original release.
                    These concepts existed even back then, when classic arcade games were remade to work on consoles
                    (usually downgraded), but the first notable Remake that gains a reptutation as a remake is Super
                    Mario
                    All Stars, which remade the NES Mario Games for the SNES, including updated graphics and slight
                    mechanical
                    gameplay differences among other things. What really sets the release apart is that the jump from 8
                    bit to 16
                    bit graphics was incredible, and soon the craze about updating old games onto new consoles gained
                    traction.
                    But at the same time, there was talk about preserving these older games in their (mostly) original
                    form, and
                    so soon remasters and remakes gained their own seperate territory, but mostly, it was still about
                    preserving
                    older games in newer eras. <br><br>Remasters are the way they are because newer hardware
                    allowed/required it and developers felt they could give an enhanced
                    experience so the game could fit modern standards, which can be as simple as making the game go from
                    4:3 to 16:9 HD.
                    Sometimes they even add or restore certain features, making it a sort of 'definitive' edition.
                    <br><br>Remakes also came about due to newer or different hardware, and it had a similar goal to
                    remasters,
                    but while they often came out of neccessity, developers started to feel they could improve or give
                    new visions to older games.
                    Remakes allowed developers to reinvent their games in their full original vision that the newer
                    hardware allowed.
                    Thus out of this also came the want to make different visions come to life too, and from
                    there...well capitalism
                    commodifies art, so what better way to make money than remake a classic? Remasters are also subject
                    to this, hence..
                    some pretty bad rereleases can come about from this.<br><br> But why would I make this site if these
                    releases were the
                    end all be all? They aren't, and they can vary considerably from the originals vision when making
                    revisions. An artistic
                    vision can be totally butchered in the process, and whether it's updating the code or making it from
                    scratch, these versions
                    develop their own distinct identity. It is worth informing gamers on how this can be, and which
                    games
                    this applies to. Why not read more articles to delve deeper into these issues? *wink wink*
