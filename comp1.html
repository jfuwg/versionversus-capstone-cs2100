                <h2>Silent Hill 2: Original VS Remake</h2>

                <p>Ah now this is a good game to compare. The original game came out on PS2 back in 2002.
                    The remake came out in 2024, so there is 22 years between these releases. Development
                    philosphies change in that time, and the studio behind the Demon Souls Remake was responible
                    for the remake. Being the most famous in the franchise, the demand was there, and they went for it.
                    The result is the ultimate representation of the state of remakes today. <br><br>
                    The OG has the classic fixed camera angles with tank controls, a staple of the horror
                    game genre in its day while the remake has an over the shoulder dynamic camera.
                </p>

                <div class="articlepic"><img src="sh2refog.jpg" alt="A picture of the Silent Hil 2 Remake"></div>
                <p>This creates a very different feeling while playing the game as the remake doesn't give me
                    as much anxiety or claustrophobia. Graphically the remake is stunning, but the grimy noisy
                    look of the original is not replicated. The fog especially is something PS2s did very well!
                    The remake can look pretty gruesome at times with all the gory details.
                </p>
                <div class="articlepic"><img src="oldjames.jpg" alt="A picture of OG James"></div>
                <div class="articlepic"><img src="newjames.jpg" alt="A picture of new James"></div>
                <p>Stylistically, these screenshots encapsulate their differences. I'd describe James,
                    the main character, as appearing to see the main character, as appearing to harbor a deep, dark
                    side to him. It's as though he's looking at a man changed by some pivotal event. But the
                    remake makes him look anxious, and somewhat distressed. The remake always takes these creative
                    liberties but never justifies it or makes it look as good. I just never felt as scared during
                    the remake.<br><br>
                    Gameplay wise, I was amazed by how fun the remake actually was in comparison to the OG.
                    You see, the OG is very clunky at times, something it shared with many other games. But also,
                    there is just more of a focus on combat in the remake. In the remake you feel like a bad MF taking
                    out these monsters...but in the original I always felt like it was a test of survival, everytime I
                    encountered a monster. Yes the combat is more fun in the remake but I think they went a little
                    overboard
                    with the focus on it, especially considering how they lengthened the game. This is one of the
                    biggest differences
                    as the original can be beaten in just 4-7 hours, but the remake is at about 12-15 hours.
                    Unfortunately I think this just works against the remake, as the added content just feels like
                    padding
                    that it doesn't need. The originals tight compact experience is altered for a more appealing
                    gameplay style.<br><br>
                    It especially sucks that the remake removes the DLC "Born From A Wish" which is an extra 1 or 2
                    hours
                    of content, with an important plot. I think it's important to know that you can't get the full
                    experience
                    with the remake. All in all the original is just better in my opinion, and I would reccomend to try
                    the remake after. I still enjoyed it after all. Both have their own worth. Ideally you'd have a CRT
                    and a PS2 for the original but...an emulator on whatever you use can work too. Try it out,
                    Silent Hill 2 is a classic for a reason.
