                <h2>Mario 64: Original VS Remake</h2>

                <p>Ahh...now this is a game I love far too much. I was too young to grow up with the original, but I
                    grew up
                    with the remake. Eventually I came around to loving original too. But enough about me, the original
                    came out
                    on (who could've guessed?) the Nintendo 64 in 1996 while the DS remake came out 2004. Okay...I for
                    one, did not
                    realize there was less than a decade between those 2. It is profoundly shocking to me how much
                    gaming and society
                    changed in that short space of time, and also because remakes usually take more time to come out.
                    One looks ancient to me
                    while the other is what I grew up with. What I assume is that they realized they could port over a
                    classic
                    but the DS having 2 screens means it was better to spice it up, and they poured so much spice in
                    that it became
                    a radically different game.
                </p>

                <p>The DS having 2 screens doesn't always take advantage of it, as most of the time it just shows the
                    map
                    in this game. Visually the screenshot nor video does justice to how it looks on a tiny DS screen
                    (trust me
                    it looks charming.) I wouldn't say the original is ugly but it's definitely a product of its time.
                    I also wouldn't say the DS looks better though, sometimes the colors (like in the pic above) don't
                    do it for me.
                    <br><br> The main gameplay remains largely the same BUT, there is so much additional content like
                    levels and
                    minigames, and new characters! Remember when unlocking Luigi was the biggest myth of its time? Well
                    you now can
                    in 64 DS. Remember the myths about unlocking Wario and Yoshi too? No? Oh..Well they're in DS as
                    well.
                    In fact, you have to play as Yoshi first and unlock Mario after! That is one gripe I have, as I
                    don't find
                    Yoshi nearly as fun, and there are certain sections added or changed that require you to switch to a
                    character
                    which just complicates things rather than makes it fun in my opinion. This does make for a more
                    distinct
                    idendity though. The little minigames are actually my favorite things as a child, they even take
                    advantage
                    of the 2 screens.

                <p> I adore so much that the DS version adds, like how you have to do a mini level inside of a level to
                    unlock Mario, Luigi, and Wario. I loved the extra stars to unlock and everything but somehow, I
                    ended up
                    liking the original more. It was a long time before I could explain to myself why this could be but
                    I realized it.
                    The new content just gets in the way. None of them are long but the straightforwardness of the
                    original just wins me
                    out. The community for the original is still so big and that plays a part too.
                    <br><br>The controls seem to be an issue for people on both versions...but the DS controls are
                    definitively
                    worse. I love how Mario moves around in the original but it's different and strange on the DS. It is
                    also
                    because of different physics in the DS and it just doesn't satisfy me as much. <br><br> All in all,
                    I love both games for different reasons and I would totally say that it is worth checking out both
                    because you will have a very different but welcome experience I would say. The N64 version has been
                    ported
                    several times, while the DS version doesn't get as much love which might be telling. But..although I
                    might be
                    blinded by nostalgia, the DS version is just something any Mario 64 needs to play. Go on, go play
                    the games and
                    have fun!
